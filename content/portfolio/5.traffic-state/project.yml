  - Traffic State is a physical visualisation of traffic in New York City, based on live data provided by the city's transport authority. It is a response to a brief called *21st Century Barometers* â€” physical devices which live in a domestic environment and provide useful daily data from the internet. The metal links hung below provide a mechanical graph of the average traffic speed for the past few hours.
  
     Working with a team of one other interaction designer and a product designer, we prototyped a number of different versions of this, from cardboard and string to the final version with laser-cut plywood. I developed a simple Processing program to parse the data and send the average speed to an Arduino inside the device, which updates regularly and powers the servos.

  - This was shown as [part of](http://socialdigital.dundee.ac.uk/digitalhallway/project/traffic-state/) the [Digital Hallway](http://socialdigital.dundee.ac.uk/digitalhallway/) exhibition in January 2013. I also co-designed/developed the [exhibition website](@root_path/portfolio/digital-hallway/).  Thanks to [David Raymond](http://davidraymonddesign.com/) for the photos.
