  - An app designed to showcase the work of DJCAD fine art student [Mariella Verkerk](http://mariellaverkerk.tumblr.com/). Using her work to brand the app, we designed, tested and prototyped an iOS app. As well as a conventional gallery of work and biography, we used openFrameworks to create an augmented reality section where work Mariella had conceived as street art could be projected onto commonplace features. This was based on the idea of work being "hidden" in plain sight and the app notifying you when you were close to it.

  - One of my colleagues built a storyboard-based prototype which we used for initial testing. This had quite an impact on our final design- people had trouble recognising the stylised buttons we had used, so we went through a number of iterations of the home screen design in particular to make it more intuitive. I then rebuilt it using [openFrameworks](http://www.openframeworks.cc/) and [ofxQCAR](https://github.com/julapy/ofxQCAR) and integrated the augmented reality section.
