  - I co-designed/developed this site for the joint Product/Interaction design exhibition held in January 2013. The site takes its cues from the presentation of the exhibition itself. Each project belongs to one of two themes, one with blue and one with brown wallpaper as an accent. We tried to make the branding as consistent as possible across all the material we created. 
        
        The site was designed and built in the space of about a fortnight, and was built from the start to be responsive. It's online at [socialdigital.dundee.ac.uk/digitalhallway](http://socialdigital.dundee.ac.uk/digitalhallway/); the piece I contributed to in the exhibition was [Traffic State](@root_path/portfolio/traffic-state/). Thanks to [Steve Swanton](https://steveswantondesign.wordpress.com/) for the photos.

  -  I implemented the site based on designs by [Tom Kinnear](http://socialdigital.dundee.ac.uk/~trkinnear/blog/). Tom's original Photoshop comps are below, although we substantially reworked and simplified the information structure of the site from what was originally proposed.
